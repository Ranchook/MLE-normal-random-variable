1st class exercise in intro ML and data science course.

## Maximum likelihood estimation of a normal random variable

The following data is given:
data =[1.42, 5.01, 2.45, 1.92, 1.41, 4.83, 1.81] 
It is known to be sampled identicaly and without statistical dependency from a probability source upholding:
$$ 𝑃(𝑥|𝜇, 𝜎^2) \sim 𝒩(𝜇, 𝜎^2) $$

### Assignments:

    1. a. Calculate the model parameters according to the data.
       b. Plot a graph showing the distribution of 𝒩 on x axis.
    2. The true values of 𝜇 and 𝜎 are given. 𝜇 = 2, 𝜎 = 1.5. Add to the real distribution to the plot.
    3. Generate a new sample series with length N=30 from a normal distribution with the true parameters 
       and repeate tasks 1, 2.
    4. Repeat task 3 10 times and create a single graph with the original distribuition and all the 10 distributions 
       with the estimated parameters.
    5. Repeate task 4 with N = 3000.
